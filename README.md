Precompiled-libsvm
==================

Precompiled libsvm for Matlab 2006 and above.

Libsvm for Matlab 2006 and above needs Windows SDk and .NET 4. This might need a download of 700mb or above just to compile libarray in Matlab. This is a precompiled Libsvm. To add this in toolbox:

1. Goto matlab root and then into Toolbox folder.
2. Create a folder libsvm inside it.
3. Add all the files into it.
4. In matlab type pathtool
5. In pathtool GUI, add path of libsvm toolbox

Done!
